Historic:
Language Learning with Legends

By Mena Filfil, Matthew Quispe, Alex Mcneilly, Luis Turino

Our project so far is an MVP that shows the feasibility of using ChatGPT as a historical language learning tool.
Language learning may get tedious, so we have created an interactive site where you can talk to a famous historical figure in the language you want to learn (currently available: Spanish, Italian) and have a full-on verbal conversation powered by AI. Perfect for all ages, and in the classroom as well. Uses OpenAI API, Google Cloud API for translation and text to speech, as well as a speech to text API.
